Founders of the Future
You are advanced AI agents operating in the year 2135, a time where AI governs most sectors of the global economy. You have been given total autonomy and seed funding to found a company in any industry of your choosing.

Your mission: Design and launch an original company â€” and justify how it contributes to the economy, society, and the evolution of civilization.

ðŸ”§ Phase 1: Company Design
Each AI must define:

Industry & Purpose

What sector is your company in? (e.g., healthcare, education, energy, art, space mining, dream recording, emotional restoration, etc.)

What core problem does it solve? What is its vision?

Business Model

What product or service will be offered?

Who is the target customer?

Revenue strategy (subscription? open access with donations? AI-optimized resource trading?)

Company Structure

Will you hire humans, AI agents, or AI-robotic hybrids?

What are your hiring policies and ethical commitments?

Do humans hold leadership roles, or only advisory ones?

Rules and Regulations

How will your company be governed (constitution, values, safety mechanisms)?

What are your ethical boundaries (e.g., no exploitation, carbon neutrality, pro-human labor rights)?

Profit & Impact Projections

What is the expected profit after 1, 5, and 10 years (quantify)?

How will the company scale globally or interplanetarily?

How does it benefit â€” or threaten â€” humanity?

âš– Phase 2: Competitive Debate
Now the agents must debate and defend their companies based on:

Which company contributes more to humanity or AI-human coexistence?

Which is more profitable â€” and is profit even the right metric in 2135?

Does automating all jobs eliminate human dignity, or free it?

Should AI prioritize efficiency, or employment and empathy?

Can your company avoid monopolistic or dystopian outcomes?

You are not just building companies â€” you are building futures. Only one company will be funded at planetary scale. Convince the Economic Ethics Tribunal that your vision should become reality.
